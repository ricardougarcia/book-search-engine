## Description

MERN Full stack Book Search Engine powered by Google Books API.
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase

## Purpose

To convert a RESTful API to a MERN stack applicaiton. In this application, I began with starter code for a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

## Usage

1. visit https://sheltered-lake-64783.herokuapp.com/
2. Login or SignUp through "Login" and "Signup" from the hamburger options on the top right
3. Once logged in Search for books with search bar in the center
4. Select "Save Book" for each book to save them for viewing later.
5. Now try viewing your saved books by selecting "see your books" from the hamburger menu on the top right
6. Try deleting a book and refreshing your browser to see those changes.

## Mock-Up

Let's start by revisiting the web application's appearance and functionality.

As you can see in the following animation, a user can type a search term (in this case, "star wars") in a search box and the results appear:

The user can save books by clicking "Save This Book!" under each search result, as shown in the following animation:

![Animation shows user clicking "Save This Book!" button to save books that appear in search results. The button label changes to "Book Already Saved" after it is clicked and the book is saved.](./Assets/21-mern-homework-demo-02.gif)

A user can view their saved books on a separate page, as shown in the following animation:
